# Weather Report In NextJS

A dynamic web application built with Next.js, Tailwind, and TypeScript that allows users to view current weather conditions, along with hourly and daily forecasts. Users can also check weather alerts and find information on sunrise and sunset times.

## Why I Built This

Weather Report was created for those who like to plan ahead and check the weather before heading out! Previously, I would dress for the occasion but often not for the weather. Now, with Weather Report, I can easily look ahead to prepare for any kind of weather. In addition to dressing appropriately, the app enables me to take precautions for severe weather conditions, whether it's a snowstorm, thunderstorm, or cyclone. With live alerts, Iâ€™m always in the know about what's coming, and you can be too! Just head over to the app and stay prepared.
